I'm excited to share this Super Store Sales Dashboard that I created with Power BI! This dashboard is a great way to track your sales performance and make informed decisions about your business.

ðŸ’¹ Learning:
Incorporated data analysis techniques, specializing in time series analysis, to deliver valuable insights, accurate sales forecasting, and interactive dashboard creation, driving business success.

ðŸ“Œ Step Followed:
1) Data Cleaning
2) Dashboard Creation
Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheets and customization using filters and slicers.
Used different types of customized visualization (Donut Chart, Stacked Area Chart, Clustered Bar Chart, Map, Line Chart, Stacked Bar Chart.)

3) Data Analysis
Provide valuable insights to make their sales strategy decisions through visualization and charts.
o  For example, the data set I have taken is of American states and cities. Now we can make decisions like in which city we are selling more products and which type of product, then we can increase the amount of that product also in which particular month we are getting more benefit on what product as per the public requires.

4) Sales Forecasting
On the basis of previous data, Iâ€™m applying time series analysis to generate a Sales Forecast for the next 15 days.
o  Benefits: Now we can prevent ourselves from huge losses or we can make a huge profit on the basis of future predicted data.

5) Actionable Insight and Recommendation
Now by applying the above step, we can make a final strategic decision in terms of growth, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.

âœ” I also used  DAX to perform advanced calculations and queries on data in the Data View section of Power BI.
